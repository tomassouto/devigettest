## Details

    - In responsive design, the menu should collapse for mobile screens and there should be an icon. http://michaelhyatt.com/ << See how this site is doing it.
    - Social Widget  will have 5 icons. Icon should only be visible if the user has specified the link for it.
    - About Widget will act like a normal text widget except it will have an image upload function.
    - Search should expand when the user clicks on the icon. Similar to TheNextWeb.com site.

You do not need to fully complete the challenge. We suggest not to spend more than 5 hours total, which can be done over the course of 2 days.  Please make commits as often as possible so we can see the time you spent and please do not make one commit.  We will evaluate the code and time spent.

What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is insufficient to solve everything.

As soon as you have submitted your solution, we will review the code and send our feedback.

Let your recruiter know when you finished. 

Best of luck,
